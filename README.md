# Natural Panoramic Controls

[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) natural panoramic camera controls.

## Description

Dragging your mouse (or panning with your finger) will rotate the camera such
that the point under your cursor in the world follows your mouse as it is
being dragged.

It also supports momentum with damping.

The experience is similar to Google Street View's.
